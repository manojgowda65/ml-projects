0,"Difficult to navigate but somewhat useful app. With rapid changes to the app's UI it becomes really difficult to navigate through the various features. I don't see my appointments under the 'Appointments' menu, but rather they show up under 'Consultation' from where I cannot reschedule. It has also become confusing to search for a doctor. Update: video calling no longer works. Doctor tried calling but I did not get any notification even when app was open. Same problem with my friends.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1,"I find the medical records section frustrating. 1. I am unable to pick a file from my cloud storage directly. Had to download file locally to the phone and then attach. I wish the jumber of steps can be simplified like other comparitive apps. 2. The name of the file does not appear; so no way to quickly understand the purpose of the file. I wish a LIST view of files to make it easy. 3. I am unable to preview the Files directly. Have to download, search for the download folder and open.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
2,"Really buggy software. And has this even been tested by devs? So after payment I don't get video consult on the expected page (the confirmation I got is via text message ) . There's a server error. Changing state when you are booking an appointment have server issues. These arnt minor bugs, these will cost you loss of patients and money.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
3,"The app keeps getting unresponsive. During consultation, could not send even a single image to the dr. The call gets dropped despite good internet connectivity. I have had this experience recently and also 8 months back. So no improvement is made with app. Atleast allow web version of the service.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
4,"Everything is good but connecting to a different doctor everytime and explaining the problems again is a pain. All documents have to be uploaded and it's very annoying. They can create a ticketing system where a new doctor connnected can have a ""lookup"" from the previous chat?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5,"The app is difficult to navigate, extremely frustrating especially when you're sick and seeking support. The payment method process is so annoying and not at all trustworthy, seems like I've wasted money here. I booked an appointment and cannot even access that because the app kept crashing and the call for disconnected automatically in seconds.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
6,"I have used Practo multiple times out of desperation for my elderly parents and almost every time there was a problem with video call feature and the conversation had to be done through chat/audio call, which greatly compromised the quality of the interaction. Deeply disappointed. Searching for better options.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
7,"Appointment confirmation page doesn't load post booking. Appointment page doesnt load even if I click the link in text message and want to edit my appointment. Feedback page doesn't load on clicking, post the appointment either. Simply saying - app doesn't load at all and is extremely difficult to navigate now, for the last few.months.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
8,The Good - Reaching the doctor for simpler consultation like vitamin deficiency issues was easy. Reaching support worked fine as we The Bad - Very bad app. Chat is difficult to use. Video does not work. App asks me to remove battery optimization for the app which is so hard to find in the middle of a consultation. File sharing in chats is poor. File gets shared as soon as selected without even clicking on the send button. The app needs serious upgrades to make the experience proper.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars
9,The app is vety useful to find good doctors nearby. But appointment/clinic timings are almost always incorrect. Doctors have now told me not to book through the app because changes are not updated and appointments scheduled without actually checking with the doctor/clinic. Quite frustrating!,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
10,Bad experience with the appointment booked. But worst is the practo response to it. They clearly are protecting the doctor and in turn their own reputation. I have submitted my feedback for the doctor twice which isn't published. Also I was supposed to get refund for the appointment that wasn't attended by doctor. Everytime they just keep on saying it's done but I haven't received.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
11,"I don't find this app much updated. When I tried booking some slots through the app, found the doctors unavailable at each case. Plus, I got a call from the clinic I wished to visit, enquiring my exact problem, which I wasn't comfortable to share. Further, the calling executive said that they cannot book any appointments unless they get the details on call. Very disappointing.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
12,"I see a lot of development required in this because of many bugs in current app version. Few if them are - 1) After initiating call through the app, sometimes call didn't get connected and we didn't get voice of each other. 2) when try to get out of chat window of any doctor, the app forcefully ask for rating of doctor and we are not able to back it unless we kill the app. The rating should not be mandatory. 3) Sometimes chat is not visible in good way like recent chat shows up.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
13,Although the app and services are okay but it has many shortcomings to be rectified. I have booked doctor's appointment through app and visited Dr. For same date and time but it is not reflected in my account and counted as I didn't visit. I even tried to contact through customer care centre to resolve the issue but all efforts and time devoted gone in vein. Finally no one is there to rectify problem I am installing the app.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

15,I am trying to buy one item from 1 week and it says unavailable.. Even after several follow up still the item is unavailable.. Enfamil stage 1 used to buy from almost 2 months regularly and now it's unavailable!! There is no option to talk to customer care on any concern also. This is Frustrating,Rated 4 stars out of five stars
16,"Earlier app design was very good like you search for medical problem. it will show you the list of doctors. you can pick any and book the consultation. Now if you search the medical problem, it will redirect to package selection page where you need to select one package atleast otherwise you can go forward. This package is for online consultation. No way to book in-clinic appointment. If it is there god knows where..Pathetic app.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
17,"Overall good. Two issues: 1. I found that sometimes doctors prescribe stronger and more medicines than necessary. Though this helps get well faster, but is costlier and may adversely impact health in the long term. 2. I would like to wait for 2 weeks begore reviewing a doctor, to be able to provide accurate feedback about the treatment. But the app asks for feedback immediately upon consultation.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
18,"Not worth it. 1. The app crashing when doctor tries video calling me. 2. Quality of online doctors not good. Had bad experience with sony mehta. 3. Some prescribed tests show CTA but when called, we get the answer that CT is not there in practo. 4. When reports come, tapping on it gives error.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
19,"I wish I could select 0 star for your app since my first experience was very bad. I installed the app , made the doctor payment, got in queue with doc, doctor asked me to wait and then all of sudden my appointment was cancelled without any info and with a message that refund has been initiated. Is this way this app works? Very disappointing. This is my first and last visit to this app. Thanks for such a nice app.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
20,"Nice app easy to use authentic and reliable. doctors are available 24*7 and also good. they listen their patient very calmly and their prescribed treatment goes very well. must use this app. if you live in rural areas or hotspitals are far from your place or your want to avoid unnecessary queue or you want treatment asap this app is for you.

22,"Practo is fooling customers with their poor service. No doctor honors their appointment, It's better to use other competitors app. Literally zero service and response from practo. They just give missed call and send a message that the issue is resolved, that's the best these guys are doing",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

25,Horrible app and customer service. Both are incompetent with zero regards for urgency especially for the diagnostic tests. This is coming even after having a corporate tie up with practo plus.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
26,The app force you to rate every doctor from the time you talk to a doctor. How will you know a doctor unless you deal with him/her for atleast a few times. And why should i be force to rate a doc.

Beware of using Practo services as the support is pathetic. I was unsure if I was to take care of my sick kid or keep spending time explaining the issue to non-supportive and stupid customer support. The only thing the ask to be patient with them. Never ever use Practo. A word of caution.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

I have been constantly trying to get in touch to get a return/replacement or refund on the delivered medicines. Horrible experience. My parents have run out of medicine today, it's been 5 days now and depending on practo seems like a big mistake. I know these are grim times, but in spite of verifying the prescription and sending the incorrect medicines when we are most dependent on it, is not practical and what if parents would have consumed it, could have led to more complications. I can't express the amount of disappointment with the attitude of service agents and time taken to initiate a replacement/return. For the last one year or so, I have been ordering medicine from practo because of the hassle free service that you used to offer, preferred over netmeds or pharmeasy. With this horrible service experience that I had it's safe to say you'll definitely lose the customer base if issues are not addressed proactively and on time. 1. Include a return or replacement option in the app. 2. Train service agents to articulate better and address issues on time. 3.

We can book appointments easily and app will remind us so that we can't miss the appointment how busy we are.. we can chat or speak on phone with plenty of doctors any time.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
849,App doesn't allow to go back to the main page from chat window without rating the doctor. Shouldbe optional. Support is useless. If you email them they'll ask you to use the chat option in app. If you chat in app they'll ask you to email them. Are your support staff being paid just to do nothing and redirect complaints from one medium to another?? All mediums should work instead of this ridiculous passing the problem to some place else. Newer version doesn't support downloading prescription,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

851,Congratulations to have such good and innovative app. It will be better to add something like expensive/moderate/affordable option (in comparison to the city standard) for doctors and hospital as some time normal practitioner ( a good one or renowned) is serving in affordable prices but only locals would be knowing about him.

If consultation fails they will give you 200cash but catch is that you cant use only 15% 🤣. Means its totally of no use. Conclusion: Dont waste money. Find some other alternative.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

5160,"Practo does not post genuine reviews about Doctors, so most of us are being presented with only the positive reviews, whereas if something went wrong, Practo rejects the review. This results us in making wrong decisions by contacting Doctors who we think are really great, but in reality, they were not remotely close to it. I posted the review below, and Practo did not update it, so I put it on FB and other places. I was the only one doing all the talking on the video call. Spent over 2 minutes explaining my sleep disorder which I’ve been experiencing for years. All I heard from the Doctor were “And”, “ok”. The video call lasted no more than 2 minutes, and nothing had been explained to me whatsoever. After the call, I received a prescription on the Practo app, which showed no improvement despite 2 nights of consuming the tablet. Hence, contacted the doctor again on Practo chat, and was given another tablet. Again, no explanation on what the tablet is about, or if I have to stop/continue the first prescription. Only after I asked, he said I should continue the first one as well, along with the latest one prescribed. Tried both medicines for 2 nights, still no change. Hence, contacted the doctor again on Practo chat, this time no response, and the Practo chat window ceased as I crossed the 7-day chat consultation period. Consulting the Doctor requires a payment of Rs500 again. I finally had to Google my condition and find a medicine, which actually worked! What’s the point of paying to consult a doctor for medication which never works, when I can get better answers on Google with medicines that actually work! Guess a Google degree is better than an MBBS degree after all. Never again going via Practo! I’m sure they won’t post this review, so I’ll make sure to post this on other social media sites, and Google.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

I wish Practo understand that this is too high for a follow up with the same doctor, I cancelled it then Practo offers me another dermatologists  again for 199/- fees. It would be in Practo's business interest to use this tele medicine platform & build customer base so that more & more people start using the app for doctor consultations at least for non emergency cases.

7105,"Horrible is the least word one can use for Practo doctors. In these trying times when people are going online to order their recovery medicine, Practo is making joke of it. We place our order with exact no of doses n people looking for the medicine, doctor via e-consultation agrees to the same but when they pass the message to pharmacy a different dose is mentioned. We are on verge of running dry with our medicine, but Practo is interested in playing Games of Phone Calls.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
7106,"Practo is a useless platform with useless doctors who doesn't have patients. You pay first, and wait for the doctors. I paid the fee after having a severe stomach pain. Doctor didn't reply for an hour. Practo customer service wasn't available outside business hours. Finally doctor called and said it's acidity, and gave prescription. After the disappointment, I went to the doctor nearby and was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and performed surgery. Thank god, I didn't trust your advice.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
7107,I was worried about my kids health while I was in a village far from good medical facilities.

7109,Never ever take advice from them... Their doctors don't have any experience... They are just like customer care executive... One of their doctor prescribed me medication and it turned out to be worse and when i complained about it i was told that we can't say anything abt doctor's advice or medication... First they put your life in danger and then they can't do anything about it... Such horrible experience,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
